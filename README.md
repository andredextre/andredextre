### Bio

Hello! I'm Andre, a recent Environmental Data Science graduate from UC Santa Barbara. I worked as a Research Assistant at the Jasechko Research Lab, where I developed my expertise in climate research, particularly in waterway resilience in the Jack & Lautra Dangermond Preserve. My significant achievement includes leading a Master’s Capstone Project with The Nature Conservancy (TNC), where my team and I conducted a vital study on the impact of wildfires on California's groundwater-dependent ecosystems (GDEs) using geospatial analysis tools in R. I have also engaged deeply with USGS water data, creating interactive maps and visualizations to better understand and communicate water usage patterns. My work is driven by a deep commitment to environmental sustainability and a passion for unlocking insights through data analysis. I am particularly interested in water data analysis, striving to integrate my technical skills in data science to influence and improve water policy and management in California. I am always keen to collaborate on projects that use data to drive environmental sustainability and enact meaningful policy transformations.

### What am I up to? 

💻📊 Currently, I'm expanding my skill set with online classes in JavaScript, R-Shiny Dashboards, and AI via [Udemy](https://udemy.com). My goal is to enhance my ability to transform complex data into clear, actionable insights and solutions, specifically focusing on water resources. This involves applying these advanced skills to address real-world challenges in water management and conservation.
